Hello!
I've now added comments below all posts using [utterances](https://utteranc.es/). You'll need to have a Github account to comment though since it uses Github issues. I probably won't moderate it very strictly, but just try to be kind on there.

Also, I've added dates to blog posts so you can see when I've made them, and pushed the posts' titles to the left instead of being centered. It doesn't really add much but I thought it made it look a bit more professional.

I'm going to start making posts about stuff like game dev probably either today or tommorrow.
